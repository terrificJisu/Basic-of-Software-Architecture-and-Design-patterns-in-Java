/**
 *
 *  S <--> SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE
 *
 *  - A software entity (class, method) should have only on reason to change
 *  - If a class or a method does more than one procedure,
 *      it is advisable to separate it into two distinct classes/methods
 *  - It can be done easily with the help of interfaces !!!
 *
 *  So, if we have 2 reasons to change for a class -> we should split the functionality
 *      into two separate classes
 *          EACH CLASS WILL HANDLE A SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY !!!
 *
 *  - It leads to a low coupled design with less and lighter dependencies
